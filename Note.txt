Packages are called bundles

How symfony work : the client send a requests , the browser send it into index.php , then the 
controller get it and manage what the user needs , then the twig which is responsible of generating
 the file that the bowser needs .

Now let's learn and do at the same time on how to create a Symfony Vue but first , let me tell you 
what is a vue exactely , ok a vue is all that we show in the web browser : in our world , it's the
html + style + dynamicity ... it's all the thing that we shaw more preciselly , it's the client view .

Let's begin so :

Let's create first the login form , the authentification form :

php bin/console make:auth
if I answered with Yes in the Password fields , I don't need anymore for an password entity comp
The entity inside my User inscription : username:unique , Email , Contact , Birth

php bin/console make:security

controller class : SecurityController 

Create a hash password : php bin/console security:hash-password
When typing the commande , it will demands for the password to be hashed , when you type the password after ,
you will not see anything like for linux password on shell . Then press Enter and your hashed password will be 
generated in a few .

- Create a register Page :
php bin/console make:entity #This commande is only used to create a registration database , and it is not the same
as the make:entity commande witch is used for an normal authentification .

php bin/console make:form RegistrationFormType User #This commande is used  to create a form inside a file called 
RegistrationFormType.php inside src/Form/ witch is based on the User entity that has been createn.

php bin/console make:controller RegistrationController # This command will create two files src/Controller/RegistrationController.php
and templates/registration/index.html.twig .
